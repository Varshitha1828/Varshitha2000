Here I am going to explain about the Basic, Intermediate and Advanced concepts in Python Programming that includes 

    1. Data Types - int(int), float(float), string(str)
    2. Type Conversions - int to float, float to int, int to string, string to int, float to string, string to float
    3. Strings - anything under '' are called strings
    4. Tuple - () repesentation
    5. List - [] represntation
    6. Set - {} representation
    7. Dictionaries - {key:value} pair represntation
    
Control and Conditional Statements :

Control Statements : 
    1. for loop
    2. while loop
    
Conditional Statements:
    1. if
    2. else
    3. elif
    4. break
    
Python Functions : Functions are used to perform a specific task.
There are two types of functions:
    1. Built-in functions :  The functions which are already there in the python community. Ex: print()
    2. user-defined functions : The functions which are used by the user. Ex: def()
